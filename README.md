# Linux Masterless Config

Designed to get a fresh, new linux machine up and running as quickly and efficiently as possible. Set to download all the packages and things I like to see on my developer machine, as well as fetch various configs stashed about the web-o-net.

## Packages
This salt stack comes with configs to download the following packages:
- Signal messenger for linux (via repo)
- Vim (plus fetch a custom .vimrc file)
- Vagrant
- Virtualbox
